                <h2>Good to Know Before Visiting Montreal</h2>
                <p>
                    Montreal is a friendly and relaxed city, but it has a few particular rules and habits.
                    These simple tips can help visitors fit in more easily and avoid small surprises.

        <h3>1. Be ready for French and English</h3>
        <p>
            Montreal is part of the French-speaking province of Quebec, so you will see French everywhere:
            on street signs, menus and in shops. Most people also speak English, especially in tourist areas,
            so you can switch between the two languages easily.

        <h3>2. Driving rules are a bit different</h3>
        <p>
            On the Island of Montreal, turning right at a red light is not allowed. Traffic lights can also flash green
            to show you have priority for turning, so pay close attention to road signs.

        <h3>3. Explore the underground city</h3>
        <p>
            Downtown Montreal has a huge underground network of tunnels, shops and metro stations. It is perfect
            for moving around in winter while staying warm and dry.

        <h3>4. Taxes and tipping on the bill</h3>
        <p>
            Prices rarely include tax. Two taxes will be added at checkout, and it is normal to leave
            a 15–20% tip in restaurants for good service.
